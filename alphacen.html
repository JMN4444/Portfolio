    <p>There are several factions in the 4x strategy game Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, each with their own varying strengths and weaknesses. Knowing what they excel in and where they are weak are key to winning the game.</p>
    <p> The focus here would be the factions of the original <i>Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri</i> and each of their corresponding Strengths and weaknesses.

      <p> A faction of Fundamentalist Christians lead by Sister Miriam Godwinson, they are a faction which is heavily opposed to unbridled scientific progress. They are by no means against technology, but rather, its unethical use. Their belief allows them field larger armies than others, albeit technologically stunted thanks to their research penalty. Their attack bonus from their convictions makes them a dangerous foe on the battlefield. They make effective spies too so they prefer to steal tech rather than research it. They are a natural enemy of the University, and a dangerous neighbor for the Morganites.</p>
      <p> As much as possible, this faction prefers to be fully aggressive against their neighbors to make full use of their abilities, which is particularly evident when the AI plays as them. So watch out when you're sharing a border with them. When fighting as and against them, always remember to strike first. Don't underestimate their attack bonus, take them out as soon as you can, as their attack bonuses hurt a LOT once they get going. They prefer a <b>FUNDAMENTALIST</b> government.</p>

      </div>
      <p>A faction of scientists who specialize in research. They have the best tech on the planet and since they have free <b>Network Nodes</b> on every of their bases and will usually have the most advanced weapons on planet. Although their research capabilities are unparalleled, this comes at the cost of increased drones and vulnerability to spies. Getting the Virtual World and Hunter Seeker Algorithm would negate the penalties of the University completely, so they are top priority when playing as them.</p>
      <p> In playing against them, use lots of probe teams. Aim for the Virtual World and Hunter Seeker Algorithm as well so they can't counter their weaknesses and strike at them with probe teams to steal their research or incite more drones in their bases. They prefer the KNOWLEDGE values.</p>

      </div>
      <p> A highly militarized faction who boasts the best military training in Chiron. Their society is based around their namesake, the Spartans, and as expected, live a rigorous and tough life. Their people are trained from birth for war, so they make for one of the best soldiers. As the Spartans, you're at your best when you're at war with your neighbors, using your better trained forces to conquer those around you. Since you start with rovers, a few conquer techs and you're already on your way. Police helps a lot with drones in conquered cities and although mineral costs are increased, your prototypes don't cost minerals. This faction is geared for war, and best use of this faction is being in one.</p>
      <p>When fighting against them, be sure to consider your strategy carefully. They may have more well trained troops, but factions with abilities to maintain or field more units would have the edge here, as their industry hit means they have less troops. Mind controlling their elite units using probes would work well here, as you can use their weapons against them. They prefer the <b>POWER</b> value.</p>

      </div>
      <p> A collectivist faction ruled by Sheng-ji Yang. Their bases are well protected thanks to being underground and can expand decently fast with their growth and industry bonuses. Coupled with the fact that they are immune to <b>EFFICIENCY</b> modifiers and you have a faction that can run both <b>PLANNED</b> and <b>POLICE STATE</b> without any penalties. One of the more powerful factions with their only weakness being their lackluster economy. They are meant to expand quickly and cover as much territory as they can...... at the expense of others too. They are great conquerors too as they can field an army as large as Miriam's. </p>
      <p>Fighting against them is tough, but doable. Try using probes to destroy their perimeter defenses. If possible, have the fight in your terms and in your territory, as having to fight them in their perimeter bases would be a challenge. Their swarms of units can be a decent source of unit promotions if you keep your units alive in your territory. Have another ally help you against them. Try draining their energy reserves so they would have a hard time maintaining their bases.They prefer a <b>POLICE STATE</b>. </p>

      </div>
      <p>A faction of capitalists. CEO Morgan and his followers are all in for a life of luxury and riches, and as such, prefer trade more than anyone else. They will have the best economy around planet and have the most energy reserves at the cost of having a smaller army than others. They can tech decently and prefer rushing production rather than hard building. The <b>SUPPORT</b> penalty means that they will have less units than others, and coupled with the Hab Complex penalty means that their starting game will be truly a struggle. Because of how they function, they are an advanced faction not recommended for those starting to play the game. The best course of action as them is to rush for Industrial Automation, which unlocks Hab Complexes, Crawlers and the <b>WEALTH</b> value, which all benefit a Morgan player.</p>
      <p>When playing against them, the earlier you meet them, the more you can cripple them severely or wipe them out. They have a really weak start, and if they don't have any probes, they'll be easy pickings. Assuming they do have probes, counter it with probes of your own or stacks of units. </p>

      </div>
      <p>The Peacekeepers are a well balanced faction, with no outstanding strengths nor weakness, and for that reason, you can play them as any way as you like. The extra talent helps a lot in building bases and the extra population before needing <b>HAB COMPLEXES</b> means they'll have larger cities than others. Starting with Biogenetics means they can aim for the Human Genome Project and potentially have two talents instead of one. A beginner friendly faction for those who wishes to know how to play the game.  </p>
      <p>The Peacekeepers are the most balanced faction, so when fighting against them, expect anything and everything, as they're the most unpredictable foe you'll face. They don't have any crippling penalties to their army in terms of numbers and morale, so fight them as you would fight any other faction.</p>

      <p>A faction of ecologists. They wish to live in harmony with the planet and embrace its lifeforms. They are highly efficient at the cost of being slightly hard to control and being averse to violence. They start off with the technologies for formers so they can begin terraforming right away. They can also capture mindworms early on, so they aren't militarily helpless as the <b>-1 MORALE</b> would make it seem. In fact, they actually make decent conquerors in that mindworms ignore tech level of the armor.</p>
      <p>When facing against them, one thing is considered: <i>STAY AWAY FROM FREE MARKET</i>. Your units would be helpless with a <b>-3 PLANET</b> slapped on them. Use <b>GREEN</b> economics as well so as to have a fighting chance against their hordes of mindworms. Their conventional units are less trained than others, so you can use that to your advantage.They prefer <b>GREEN</b> economics.</p>
